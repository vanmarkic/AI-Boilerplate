description: Resume work using Task Orchestrator - loads context and picks up the next task
---
Resume work on the project. Use the Task Orchestrator MCP tools.

## Step 1: Load context

Call `get_context` to see:
- Active tasks (in work or review)
- Blocked tasks
- What changed since last session

## Step 2: Pick next task

If no task is in progress, call `get_next_item` to get the highest-priority unblocked task.

## Step 3: Read the task notes

Call `query_notes` with the task's `itemId` to read its requirements note. This tells you what to implement.

## Step 4: Start working

Call `advance_item` with `trigger: "start"` to move the task from queue to work.

Then implement the task following these rules:
- Read existing code before writing new code
- Follow project conventions in `.continue/rules/`
- One layer at a time (model → schema → repository → service → router → test)
- Under 200 lines per file

## Step 5: Complete the task

When done:
1. Run relevant tests (`make test-backend` or `make test-frontend`)
2. Run `make lint-arch` to check layer boundaries
3. Call `advance_item` with `trigger: "start"` to advance (work → review → done)
4. Call `manage_notes` to add a completion note with `key: "done-summary"`, `role: "review"`, describing what was implemented

## Step 6: Next task or stop

Call `get_next_item` again. If another task is ready, repeat from Step 3. If all remaining tasks are blocked, report what's blocking and stop.
