description: Resume work - load context from Task Orchestrator and implement next task
---
Use Task Orchestrator MCP tools to find and implement the next task.

1. Call `get_context` to see active and blocked items.
2. Call `get_next_item` to pick the highest-priority unblocked task.
3. Call `query_notes` with that item's ID to read its requirements.
4. Call `advance_item` with trigger "start" to mark it in-progress.
5. Implement the task following the requirements note. Read existing files before writing.
6. After implementation, call `advance_item` with trigger "start" again to advance to done.
