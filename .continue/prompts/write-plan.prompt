description: Create a detailed implementation plan with bite-sized TDD tasks
---
Create an implementation plan for: {{{ input }}}

## Plan Format

Save to: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

### Header

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence]
**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences]
**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies]

---
```

### Each Task (< 200 lines changed)

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing:lines`
- Test: `exact/path/to/test`

**Step 1: Write failing test**
(complete test code)

**Step 2: Run test — verify it fails**
Run: `exact command`
Expected: FAIL with "reason"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**
(complete implementation code)

**Step 4: Run test — verify it passes**
Run: `exact command`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**
```

## Rules

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits
- Tasks in dependency order
- Note which tasks are independent (parallelizable)
- Each step is one action (2-5 minutes)

Create the plan for "{{{ input }}}".
